Write a program that has a conversation with the user. The program must ask for strings, integers and floats as input. The program must ask for at least 4 different inputs from the user. The program must reuse atleast 4 of these inputs in what it displays on the screen. The program must perform at least 2 arithmetic operations on the numbers the user inputs.  Please turn in your .py file.

Please include comments in your code to explain how it works

An example program run might look like (have fun with this and be creative):
‘What is your name?’
“Josh”
‘Thanks, Josh.  What is your favorite color?’
“green”
‘Mine too.  Do you also like Ice Cream?’
“No”
‘Josh, how old are you?’
“40”
‘... and how many siblings do you have?’’
“3”
‘That means you are one of 4 kid(s). Is green the favorite color of anyone else in your house?’
"No"
'How old is on of your parents?'
"75"
'That means they were likely 35 when they had you'
