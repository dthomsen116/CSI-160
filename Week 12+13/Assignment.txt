This lab spans 2 weeks. At the end of the first week you must make an initial submission.

Write a program of your choice that leverages a public API.  You should be creative here.  What would be useful for a user?  If you may NOT use one of the APIs that I demonstrated in class.  You must demonstrate the ability to:

Make API get requests passing parameters with the requests
Understand the API documentation
Analyze the data returned in the call and utilize keys to retrieve values
Manipulate the data in creative ways
Tip: Try out the API as early in the week as possible!  You may need to request an API key and you may find that the data is less useful than you hoped.  Make sure you expose any problems early in the process.

Initial Draft (End of Week 12) - For your initial draft (worth 5 points) you must:

Select your API
Successfully make api requests of that API
Be able to navigate at least some of the data retrieved and display it in a useful way
Here are some free APIs for you to consider:
